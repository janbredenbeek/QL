<h2>ls_bas</h2>

A Unix-like 'ls' command written in SBASIC for QDOS and SMSQ/E. Includes a 'lsr' command to list and search directories recursively.
It recognises hard subdirectories (V2 drivers) and, unlike the DIR and WSTAT commands, lists files with length and date info on one line while retaining readability as much as possible.
